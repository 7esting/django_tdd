What's in this repo?

Sample code from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/django-1-6-test-driven-development/) that demonstrates What is Test Driven Development.

I will also use this as a sample application for learning to setup a CI/CD Pipeline and deploy from this repository to a cloud instance.
